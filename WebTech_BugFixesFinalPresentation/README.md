Sumbary - Summary Library Database

Version - Final presentation

-- Due to delivering wrong version for the final deadline, this is the version with the approperiate bugfixes

These bugs mostly include redirection errors when URL has more than 1 subsection 
Ex :/summary/9 to logout redirects to /summary/logout instead of /logout

Bugs fixed:
- Logout not redirecting correctly
- Link to user page not displaying username on all pages
- Text not displaying correctly in Subject.html due to a wrong call to database
- iFrame showing PDFs having a link error
